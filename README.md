## [Live App](https://appetize.io/app/yrrq64xw7y84gn159k1xb98tr4) - Take the app for a live spin here.

## About
- A simple MVVM project designed to be have low coupling with some degree of cohesion.
- This project is created with code re-usability, a screaming architecture, some solid principles like
single responsibility and dependency injection mind.
- The project domain has been modeled from the given exercise ui, a file called Development Tasks.doc
in the project file structure.
- However small it is, with time, it has the potential to be an over engineered application (For
good sleep), meaning CLEAN ARCHITECTURE.
- On top of that, you can easily plug in the network layer, implement cache and have the app running
 in no time.
- More importantly, the project also leverages some of kotlin's more exciting features, like the use
 of extension functions, sealed classes, lambdas functions, coroutines, and so on.

## Built Using ðŸ› 
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android
development.
- [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding
  class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that
  interacts with views.
- [Room DB](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Used to locally store our data.
- [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - For dependency injection.
- [Data Binding](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Used especially to bind data to the recyclerview.
- [Material Design](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Core design principles used to design the application.
- [Navigation Component](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Navigation system through the app.
- [Android Studio](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Arctic fox 2020.3.1
